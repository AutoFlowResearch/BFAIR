Study Title	"Disease progression-associated alterations in fecal metabolites in SAMP1/YitFc mice, a Crohn’s disease model"
Study Description	"<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Although its precise etiology has not been fully elucidated, imbalance of the intestinal microbiota has been known to play a role in CD. Fecal metabolites may be related to the onset and progression of CD.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> This study aimed to clarify the transition of fecal metabolites associated with disease progression using SAMP1/YitFc mice, mouse models of spontaneous CD.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Feces from control ICR (n = 6) and SAMP1/YitFc (n = 8) mice at different ages were subjected to 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The obtained NMR spectra were used for multivariate and quantitative analyses.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Fecal metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, lactate, glucose, xylose, and choline, dramatically fluctuated with disease progression before histological abnormalities associated with CD were apparent in SAMP1/YitFc mice. Unlike that of other metabolites, fecal taurine concentration in SAMP1/YitFc was high regardless of age.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The fecal metabolites showing characteristic fluctuations may be utilized as potential biomarkers in predicting CD pathology.</p>"

Study Protocol Description	"<p>SAMP1/YitFc mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan (Yokohama, Japan) and propagated at a laboratory in Hokkaido University. 3-week-old healthy ICR mice were purchased from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan), housed in individual cages in a room maintained at 25 ± 2 °C and 12-h light/dark cycle, and provided free access to a water and CE-2 diet (CLEA japan). The study design was approved by the Hokkaido University Animal Committee, and the animals were maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Hokkaido University.</p><p><br></p><p>Fecal samples obtained from ICR (n = 6) and SAMP1/YitFc (n = 8) mice were immediately frozen at −80 °C. The frozen feces samples were freeze-dried and stored at 4 °C until further analysis.</p>"	"<p>No extractions were carried out in this study.</p>"	"<p>Aliquots of 50 mg powdered feces were mixed with 1.4 ml phosphate-buffered saline in highly purified light water containing 50 mM NaP, 0.5 mM 3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-d 4 sodium salt (TSP), 0.004% NaN3, and 10% D2O. TSP and D2O were used as an internal standard and internal lock solvent, respectively. This mixture was shaken at 1800 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C using a tube mixer (EYELA CM-1000; Wakenyaku, Kyoto, Japan). The shaken samples were centrifuged at 16,100 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants pH were adjusted to approximately 7.4. 550 µl of the pH adjusted supernatants were transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube (Shigemi, Hachioji, Japan) for analysis.</p>"	"<p>1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz AVANCE III spectrometer (Brucker, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at proton frequency 600.13 MHz. The NMR probe was 5-mm TXI 1H/D-13C/15N XYZ-GRD. The magnetic field strength in NMR spectra was 14.1 tesla.</p>"	"<p>Sample temperature was controlled at 298 K. Each spectrum consisted of 128 scans of 32,768 data points with spectral width of 16 ppm and 1.7 s acquisition time. noesy1d presaturation pulse sequence was used to reduce residual water signal with low-power selective pulse at the water frequency during a recycle delay [D1 (Bruker notated) = 4.0 s] and a mixing time [D8 (Bruker notated) = 0.1 s]. A 90° pulse length was automatically calculated at each sample analysis.</p>"	"<p>All raw spectra were manually corrected for phase and baseline distortions, and referenced to the TSP resonance at δ = 0.0 ppm using Delta 5.0.4 (JEOL, Akishima, Japan). The spectra were normalized by referring to the peak area value of TSP, an internal standard, using NMR Suite 7.5 Processor (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Canada). The normalized spectral data were exported to NMR Suite 7.5 Profiler (Chenomx Inc.) for further processing. In the first processing, the chemical shift region of 0.0-10.0 ppm was integrated into regions with a width of 0.04 ppm. The spectral regions of residual water area (4.68-4.88 ppm) were removed from the analysis to eliminate the effects of imperfect water saturation.</p>"	"<p>Metabolite assignment and quantification were determined by referencing the 600 MHz library from the Chenomx database and from previously published literature<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Torres Santiago G, Serrano Contreras JI, Meléndez Camargo ME, Zepeda Vallejo LG.
