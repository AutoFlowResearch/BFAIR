MFA sampling
============

.. currentmodule:: BFAIR.mfa.sampling

Tools were set up to facilitate the analysis of the fluxes calculated in a metabolic flux analysis. Some tools that can help adapting naming conventions if different models were used and identifying exchange fluxes, i.e. fluxes with non-overlapping forward- and reverse reactions, are presented first, followed by methods to add the MFA-calculated fluxes as constraints to a COBRA model and how to deal with infeasible solutions.

Compatibility
-------------

If a different model was used for the MFA than for the subsequent analysis (e.g. a reduced model rather than a genome scale model), issues with the naming conventions might arise. Here, some functions that help with consolidating these models are provided.

Sampling
--------

Methods are provided to apply the MFA-calculated fluxes as constraints to the model that is used for further analyses and to deal with infeasible solutions.
