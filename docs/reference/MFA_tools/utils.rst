MFA statistics
==============

.. currentmodule:: BFAIR.mfa.utils

Several tools to calculate relevant indicators about the performed MFA are presented here. The split ratio at branching points, the observable fluxes and the percentage of them compared to all of the calculated fluxes and the flux precision.
